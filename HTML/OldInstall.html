    <b>**NOTE**</b>:
    Installing GCC-XML has been significantly
    simplified by combining a patched GCC with the GCC-XML front-end
    in a single source tree.  This page is provided for historical
    purposes.  Please see the
    <a href="Install.html">current installation instructions</a>
    if you are new to GCC-XML.
    <p>
    Installing GCC-XML involves two components:
    <ol>
      <li> A front-end executable that makes GCC-XML easy to run
           (<code>gccxml</code>).
      <li> The GCC exectutable with the XML-dump extension
           (<code>gccxml_cc1plus</code>).
    </ol>
    Each component may need to be built and installed separately.  On
    Windows, there is a pre-compiled package with an installation
    program that installs both components.  Refer to the <a
    href="OldDownload.html">Download</a> page to get it.
    <p>
    Before you install GCC-XML, you should check that your compiler is
    supported.  In this case, compiler support refers to what
    compilers can be simulated, not what compilers can be used to
    build GCC-XML.  See the page on <a href="Running.html">Running</a>
    GCC-XML for a list of supported compilers.
    <p>

    <h2>The <code>gccxml_cc1plus</code> Executable</h2>
    The first part to build and install is the patched GCC executable,
    which will become <code>gccxml_cc1plus</code>.

    <h3>Windows</h3>
    In order to build <code>gccxml_cc1plus</code> on Windows, you will
    need the <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">Cygwin</a>
    tools with its version of GCC.  Once you have obtained these,
    follow the UNIX instructions to build <code>gccxml_cc1plus</code>.
    <p>
    If installing cygwin is not an option, you may wish to just get
    the pre-built binary copy of the executable available on the <a
    href="OldDownload.html">Download</a> page.  The binary copy of
    <code>gccxml_cc1plus</code> does not include the GCC-XML front-end
    (but the installer download includes both).  You may still build
    the front-end yourself without Cygwin.

    <h3>UNIX & Cygwin</h3>

    There are two ways to build the <code>gccxml_cc1plus</code>
    executable.  Choose one of these:
    <ul>
      <li> Download the pre-patched source to GCC and build it.
           See the <a href="OldDownload.html">Download</a> page
           to get it.  This is the recommended approach for UNIX users, and
           is detailed below.

      <li> Download the entire GCC 3.0.4 compiler source from
           <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GCC's web site</a>, apply the
           GCC-XML patch, and install the compiler with the extension
           built in.  See the page on <a
           href="Patching_GCC.html">Patching GCC</a> for instructions.
    </ul>
    Follow the instructions below to build the part of GCC you need to
    get the <code>gccxml_cc1plus</code> executable.  It is assumed
    that you have extracted the pre-patched GCC source in your home
    directory, so the source appears in
    <code>~/gccxml-0.4.2-cc1plus-304</code>.  You will build the program
    in a parallel directory called <code>~/gccxml-0.4.2-cc1plus-304-build</code>.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Configure and build GCC (but don't install it).  Don't bother
        with a bootstrap, just run <code>make</code> after the
        configuration step.  Example:
        <blockquote>
          <code>
            $ cd ~<br>
            $ mkdir gccxml-0.4.2-cc1plus-304-build<br>
            $ cd gccxml-0.4.2-cc1plus-304-build<br>
            $ ../gccxml-0.4.2-cc1plus-304/configure \<br>
                --enable-languages=c++ \<br>
                --without-libstdcxx<br>
            $ make<br>
          </code>
        </blockquote>
        This example builds all of GCC's C++ compiler and its standard library,
        but all you really need is one exectuable.  If you want to try to
        build the minimal portion of GCC needed, try
       <a href="direct_build.html">these</a> instructions.
        If you want more detailed instructions about building GCC,
        go <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/install/index.html">here</a>.
      <li> <a name="ExeStep2"></a>

        When the build finishes, find the file
        <code>~/gccxml-0.4.2-cc1plus-304-build/gcc/cc1plus</code>.
        This program is GCC's C++ compiler which is run by the
        <code>gcc</code> driver program for C++ sources.  It does not
        automatically add any preprocessor macros (like
        <code>__GNUC__</code>), so we can use it to exactly control
        how our source is parsed.  This is the only part of the
        compiler you need, and is the <code>gccxml_cc1plus</code>
        executable.  Copy this program to the directory
        <code>PREFIX/bin</code>, and rename it to
        <code>gccxml_cc1plus</code> (keep the .exe extension under
        Cygwin).  Here, "<code>PREFIX</code>" refers to your GCC-XML
        front-end installation prefix, such as <code>/usr/local</code>
        (see below).

    </ol>
    <a name="FrontEnd"></a>
    <h2>The <code>gccxml</code> Front-End</h2>
    The front-end program wraps the <code>gccxml_cc1plus</code>
    exectuable and makes it easy to run by automatically determining
    the set of flags needed to make GCC-XML parse your code just as
    your compiler would.  See the page on <a
    href="Running.html">Running</a> GCC-XML for details.
    <p>
    In order to build and install the front-end, you will need a copy
    of the GCC-XML source.  See the <a
    href="OldDownload.html">Download</a> page to get it.  The standard
    way to build the GCC-XML front-end is to use <a
    href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> (version 1.2 or higher).
    CMake will generate an appropriate build system for your platform
    and compiler.  Binaries are available on the CMake web page for
    many platforms.
    <p>
    <h3>Windows</h3>
    Run the CMakeSetup GUI to generate the build system for your
    compiler.  Load the resulting project file and build it.  Place
    the <code>gccxml_cc1plus</code> executable (built above) at the
    top of your build tree.  You should be able to run the
    <code>gccxml</code> executable directly from the build directory.
    Currently there is no support for installing GCC-XML from a
    Windows build.  If you want to install it, use the installer
    program available on the <a href="OldDownload.html">Download</a>
    page.
    <h3>UNIX & Cygwin</h3>
    These instructions assume that the front-end will be built
    out-of-source (recommended), but an in-source build should also
    work.  The commands below assume that you have extracted the
    source code into your home directory as <code>~/gccxml-0.4.2</code>
    <blockquote>
      <code>
        $ mkdir gccxml-0.4.2-build<br>
        $ cd gccxml-0.4.2-build<br>
        $ cmake ../gccxml-0.4.2<br>
        $ make<br>
        $ make install<br>
      </code>
    </blockquote>
    You can change the install prefix by adding
    <code>-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/installation/path</code> to the
    CMake command (default is <code>/usr/local</code>).  If you are
    familiar with CMake, you should probably use the
    <code>ccmake</code> curses dialog instead.
    <p>
    This will install an executable called "<code>gccxml</code>" in
    <code>PREFIX/bin</code>.  You should place the
    <code>gccxml_cc1plus</code> executable next to it in this
    directory.  Support library files will also be installed in
    <code>PREFIX/share/GCC_XML</code>.
    <p>
    The "<code>make install</code>" step is optional.  If you place
    the <code>gccxml_cc1plus</code> executable in your build tree
    instead, then you will be able to run <code>gccxml</code> directly
    from there.
