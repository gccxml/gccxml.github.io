    Installing GCC-XML has been significantly
    simplified by combining a patched GCC with the GCC-XML front-end
    in a single source tree.  For those interested, the
    <a href="OldInstall.html">old install instructions</a> are still
    available.
    <p>
    This page covers the build and installation process of GCC-XML
    from source.  Refer to the <a href="Download.html">Download</a>
    page to get a copy of the source tree.
    <p>
    GCC-XML uses <a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> to support
    building on many platforms.  A copy of CMake may be obtained from
    the <a href="http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html">CMake
    download page</a>.  CMake will generate an appropriate build
    system for your platform and compiler.
    <p>
    <h3>Windows</h3>
    Run the CMakeSetup GUI and specify the GCC-XML tree for the source
    directory.  Specify a directory of your choice as the build
    directory (typically this is placed next to the source directory).
    Select the desired build system generator from the drop down menu.
    Use the GUI to generate a build system
    for GCC-XML on your computer.  Then use the corresponding native
    tools on your system to actually build GCC-XML.
    <p>
    When the build finishes, there will be a "<code>gccxml</code>"
    executable in the <code>bin</code>, <code>bin/Debug</code>, or
    <code>bin/Release</code> directory inside the build tree depending
    on the build system you chose.  It may be run directly from this
    location.  Installation from a build tree is not currently
    supported on Windows.

    <h3>UNIX & Cygwin</h3>
    These instructions assume that GCC-XML will be built
    out-of-source (recommended), but an in-source build should also
    work.  The commands below assume that you have extracted the
    source code into your home directory as <code>~/gccxml</code>
    <blockquote>
      <code>
        $ mkdir gccxml-build<br>
        $ cd gccxml-build<br>
        $ cmake ../gccxml<br>
        $ make<br>
        $ make install<br>
      </code>
    </blockquote>
    You can change the install prefix by adding
    <code>-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/installation/path</code> to the
    CMake command (default is <code>/usr/local</code>).  If you are
    familiar with CMake, you should probably use the
    <code>ccmake</code> curses dialog instead.
    <p>
    This will install an executable called "<code>gccxml</code>" in
    <code>PREFIX/bin</code> and a supporting executable called
    "<code>gccxml_cc1plus</code>".  Supporting files will also
    be installed in <code>PREFIX/share/gccxml-<i>version</i></code>.
    <p>
    The "<code>make install</code>" step is optional.  The
    <code>gccxml</code> executable may be run directly from the build
    tree.  It will be located in <code>gccxml-build/bin</code>.
